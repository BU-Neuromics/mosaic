"""Referential integrity for polymorphic-base references (issue #127).

A single-valued reference whose range is a **polymorphic base** (abstract, or
concrete with concrete subclasses) gets no SQL foreign key — subtype instances
are dispatched to their own per-class tables, so no single table can be the FK
target (issue #93), and the DDL drops the constraint. Before this fix the
referential-integrity check was dropped with it: a dangling reference on such a
slot was silently accepted on both `put` and `ingest` (`errors=0`, no
exception), while a non-polymorphic reference (a real FK) still caught it.

The check is now performed in the application layer against the
``_entity_registry`` cross-class index, deferred to commit so forward
references within a staged bundle still resolve — mirroring the deferred-FK
behavior for non-polymorphic references (issue #95).
