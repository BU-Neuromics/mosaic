"""Foundational tests for the staged commit-or-rollback scope (sec11 §11.5.2).

The S4 lifecycle orchestrator wraps a whole multi-package, multi-hop
migration chain in a single commit-or-rollback scope
(:meth:`HippoClient.staged_transaction` →
:meth:`SQLiteAdapter.staged_transaction`). Two load-bearing properties make
that correct on SQLite's one-connection-per-thread model:

* writes staged inside the scope (deferred, uncommitted) are visible to
  reads on the **same** connection — so a later hop's transform reads the
  earlier hop's output via ``client.query``, and the end-to-end gate sees
  the staged base write-set together with the extension's existing rows;
* if anything escapes the scope (e.g. the gate raising
  :class:`MigrationGateError`), every staged write rolls back together —
  nothing is left half-committed.

These tests pin both properties down before the orchestrator is built on
them.
