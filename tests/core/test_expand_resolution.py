"""End-to-end `expand=` resolution against a real SQLite-backed client (#128).

Reference slots are stored as bare ids — a single-valued reference is a plain
string id, a multivalued reference a hydrated ``list[str]`` (issue #79 /
ADR-0002). The pre-#128 `BatchFetcher` only recognized nested ``list[dict]`` /
``dict`` shapes, so `client.get(..., expand=...)` silently resolved nothing
against real entity data — every prior expand test used a `Mock()` storage with
hand-shaped nested dicts and never caught it. These tests exercise a real
adapter so that class of regression is caught going forward.
