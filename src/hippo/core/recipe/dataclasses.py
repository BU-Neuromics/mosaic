"""Recipe subsystem Python dataclasses.

Pure data containers — no behavior. Mirror the LinkML shapes declared in
``src/hippo/schemas/recipe_manifest.yaml`` for Python-side ergonomics
inside :class:`hippo.core.recipe_service.RecipeService` (Phase 3+).

The LinkML schema remains the source of truth for instance validation;
these dataclasses exist so the SDK can speak in typed Python instead of
dicts once the manifest has been validated.

See ``design/sec10_recipes.md`` §10.3 for per-field semantics.
