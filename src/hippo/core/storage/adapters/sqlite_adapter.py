"""SQLite storage adapter with WAL mode support.

The SQLite adapter provides:
- WAL mode for improved concurrency
- Automatic trigger creation for ProvenanceRecord immutability
- Thread-safe connection management

## ProvenanceRecord Immutability Triggers

Enforces ``hippo_append_only: true`` on the ``ProvenanceRecord`` table
(sec9 §9.6 / Decision 9.6.C) at the SQL level:

- ``prevent_provenance_update``: rejects any UPDATE on ProvenanceRecord
- ``prevent_provenance_delete``: rejects any DELETE on ProvenanceRecord

Triggers use ``CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS`` for idempotent initialization.
