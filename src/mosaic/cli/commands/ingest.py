"""LinkML-native instance YAML ingest for the Mosaic CLI.

``mosaic ingest`` accepts a tree-root LinkML instance bundle: a YAML mapping
whose top-level keys are class accessors (``samples:``, ``projects:`` etc.)
and whose values are lists of instance dicts. Identity is by the
``id`` slot on each instance; re-ingest of an existing id updates that
entity in place. There is no separate wrapper format and no top-level
``external_id`` field — register external IDs by including ``external_ids:``
entries in the same bundle (see ``hippo_core.ExternalID``).

CSV/JSON operational data files are not accepted here; those belong to
Cappella.
