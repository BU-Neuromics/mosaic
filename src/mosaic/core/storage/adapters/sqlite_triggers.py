"""SQL trigger definitions for ProvenanceRecord immutability.

Enforces ``hippo_append_only: true`` (sec9 §9.6 / Decision 9.6.C) at the
SQL level — UPDATE and DELETE against the ``ProvenanceRecord`` table are
rejected by SQLite itself, not just by the Python adapter. Direct-SQL
access (e.g., raw ``sqlite3`` CLI) bypasses Python-level checks but not
triggers, so this is the preferred enforcement mechanism.

The single ``BEFORE UPDATE`` trigger (without a column list) fires on
any column change and replaces the earlier per-column triggers, which
were brittle when slot names evolved.
