"""Shared, transport-agnostic type model derived from a LinkML schema.

Single source of truth for "how a LinkML schema maps to a typed surface",
consumed by every transport so they cannot drift:

- the typed SDK (Pydantic accessors) — :mod:`mosaic.core.typed_client`
- the GraphQL transport (Strawberry types) — ``mosaic.graphql`` (issue #45)
- the OpenAPI/JSON-Schema transport — REST (issue #46)

This module answers the questions all three previously answered separately:
which classes are exposed, how each slot's range classifies (scalar / enum /
class-reference), the relationship targets, enum values, and which fields are
system vs. computed-temporal. Each transport renders this model into its own
type system; the classification lives here once.

No transport types and no business logic live here — only a normalized view
over a :class:`~mosaic.linkml_bridge.SchemaRegistry`.
