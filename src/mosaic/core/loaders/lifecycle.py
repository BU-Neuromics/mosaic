"""Reference-loader install/upgrade/deprovision lifecycle orchestration
(Mosaic design §2.14).

Core (SDK-layer) business logic for the loader-driven install / upgrade /
deprovision / bundle-migrate lifecycle. Moved out of the CLI layer
(``mosaic.cli.commands.reference``) per issue #69 — a follow-up to #67 /
PR #68, which relocated schema-package *discovery* and ``requires:``
resolution to :mod:`mosaic.core.loaders.discovery`. This module carries no
CLI dependency (no ``typer``/``argparse``); the ``mosaic reference`` CLI
verbs are thin wrappers over the entry points here.

The flow is:

1. Resolve a registered :class:`ReferenceLoader` from the
   ``mosaic.reference_loaders`` entry-point group (PTS-224).
2. Merge the loader's :meth:`schema_fragment` into the deployed schema
   via :func:`mosaic.linkml_bridge.merge_loader_fragment` (PTS-226).
3. Apply the resulting schema additively against the DB (the same
   migration pipeline ``mosaic schema migrate`` drives).
4. Hand a :class:`MosaicClient` to ``loader.load()`` / ``loader.upgrade()``
   inside a :meth:`MosaicClient.load_context` so every ``client.put()``
   appends a row to ``reference_write_log`` (sec2 §2.14.9, D2.14.J).
5. Record ``{loader_name: version}`` in ``hippo_meta.reference_versions``
   so ``requires:`` and "already installed" checks have a fixed source
   of truth. The v1 ``hippo_meta.reference_entity_ids`` JSON blob is
   gone — ``--prune-old`` queries the write log instead.

Decisions D2.14.F (additive upgrade, opt-in ``--prune-old``),
D2.14.I (``"test"`` reserved slug), and D2.14.J (write-log-driven
prune) are enforced here.

The CLI module ``mosaic.cli.commands.reference`` re-exports the public
(and several private, test-monkeypatched) names here for backwards
compatibility, so existing imports of
``mosaic.cli.commands.reference.install_reference`` (etc.) keep working.
