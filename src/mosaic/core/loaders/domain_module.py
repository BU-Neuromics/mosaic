"""``DomainModule`` species and single-hop ``evolve`` (Doc 2 §2A, sec11 §11.2.4).

``DomainModule`` is the *first-party mutable-data* species of the
:class:`~mosaic.core.loaders.schema_package.SchemaPackage` genus. Where
:class:`~mosaic.core.loaders.reference.ReferenceLoader` wraps externally
maintained, reconstructible reference datasets, a ``DomainModule`` owns
the deployment's **locally authored, operational** records — the lab's
authoritative domain data — and migrates them *in place* across versions.

It satisfies the :class:`~mosaic.core.loaders.schema_package.MigratableData`
capability protocol via two members:

* :meth:`DomainModule.migration_steps` — the declared migration edges.
* :meth:`DomainModule.evolve` — runs the single declared
  ``(from_version → to_version)`` step (S2 scope).

Semantic transformation model (sec11 §11.3, Doc 2 §5.2)
-------------------------------------------------------
A migration step is a small, independently testable transform that
**reads old-shape records, writes new-shape records, and supersedes the
old**. Each migrated record becomes a *new* entity (fresh id) and the
old entity is marked superseded by it (``supersede_entity``), so:

* the append-only, id-keyed, provenanced substrate makes the migration
  auditable and replay-recoverable (Doc 2 §2 rationale);
* every step emits ``supersede`` provenance events + a ``superseded_by``
  relationship edge ⇒ traceable lineage.

A consequence worth recording: after a migration, anything that
referenced an ``old_id`` now points at a superseded / unavailable
entity; resolution is via the ``superseded_by`` edge. This does not
surface in a single-class S2 proof, but S3 (multi-hop) and S4
(cross-package orchestration) inherit it.

Hard validation gate (sec11 §11.5.2, Doc 2 §5.4)
------------------------------------------------
The transform output is **staged** and dry-run-validated against the
fully merged schema *before any committed write*; the migration commits
only on green. In-process this reuses the same primitive the
``mosaic ingest --validate-schema <merged-dir> --dry-run`` CLI path
calls — :meth:`SchemaRegistry.validate` against the merged registry the
client already operates on (:attr:`MosaicClient.registry`). Only the
*new* records are validated; the old superseded rows are v1-shape and
are never re-validated.

Migration chain (S3, sec11 §11.3)
---------------------------------
``evolve`` resolves a path through the declared migration **DAG**, not a
single edge. :meth:`migration_steps` is read as a directed graph whose
nodes are version slugs and whose edges are the declared
``(from_version → to_version)`` transforms. :meth:`_resolve_path`
breadth-first-searches that graph from the deployment's current version
to the target, so the **fewest-hop** path wins — which means a declared
*shortcut* edge (e.g. a direct ``1.2.0 → 2.0.0`` bulk transform) is
preferred over the equivalent multi-step chain automatically, with no
special-casing. A single-hop upgrade is just a one-edge path through the
same resolver. Each hop is staged → gated → committed in turn (§11.3.3),
so a 3-hop upgrade composes its intermediate steps in order.

Two fail-loud boundaries (no silent fallback, sec11 §11.3.2):

* **Below the floor.** If the current version is not a node anywhere in
  the DAG, it predates the oldest shipped step; the resolver raises
  :class:`~mosaic.core.exceptions.MigrationFloorError` (*upgrade to
  ≥<floor> first*). The chain ships every step back to that floor, like
  an Alembic ``versions/`` directory — old package code is never fetched.
* **No path to target.** If the target is unreachable from a known
  current node, :class:`~mosaic.core.exceptions.MigrationStepNotFoundError`
  is raised.

``deprovision`` (S3, sec11 §11.4)
---------------------------------
A :class:`DomainModule` **refuses to deprovision by default when it owns
live domain data** (§11.4.3): its records are the lab's authoritative
operational data, so a silent soft-delete on uninstall would be a
data-loss event. The operator must pass ``force=True`` (ideally after an
export), which soft-deletes the populated rows via the standard
availability transition. The complementary *dependents guard* (§11.4.4 —
refuse to deprovision a package others ``depends_on``) lives in the CLI
orchestrator, which alone holds the installed-package graph.

Atomicity note (sec11 §11.8 [VERIFY], resolved S3)
--------------------------------------------------
There is **no** whole-``evolve`` (or whole-``upgrade()``) multi-entity
transaction. Each ``client.put`` and each ``client.supersede_entity``
opens its own SQL transaction (``SQLiteAdapter.create`` /
``update_data`` / ``ProvenanceService.supersede_entity`` — every one
wraps a single ``_storage._transaction()``), so a failure *between*
committed writes leaves partial state with no rollback across the chain.
The pre-commit staged gate (:meth:`_run_gate`) is the mitigation — it
catches schema-invalid output before *any* write — but it cannot undo a
runtime fault during the commit loop. True end-to-end commit-or-rollback
is the S4 orchestrator's job (sec11 §11.5.2).
