"""Dependency-ordered lifecycle orchestrator + staged commit-or-rollback.

sec11 §11.5; Doc 2 §2A / §5.4 / §6 / §7. This is the unified lifecycle
orchestrator that subsumes the per-loader, *unordered* ``mosaic reference
upgrade`` path. It:

1. Resolves the ``depends_on`` graph across the participating packages once
   and topologically sorts it (base before dependents — :func:`topological_sort`).
2. Drives the deployment through the target :class:`~mosaic.core.loaders.bundle.Bundle`'s
   coordinate sequence; at **each** hop it dispatches ``evolve`` per package
   in dependency order, so an extension's step always runs after its base
   has reached that hop's shape (sec11 §11.5.1).
3. Wraps the whole chain in a single staged commit-or-rollback scope
   (:meth:`MosaicClient.staged_transaction`). After all hops it runs the
   **end-to-end gate** — validating the full post-migration state, including
   the lab's existing extension records, against the merged schema
   (:func:`run_end_to_end_gate`, sec11 §11.5.2 / §6.3). One commit on green;
   roll everything back on any failure.

The end-to-end gate is the backstop that *blocks* a stranded extension
field at migration time; the exposure report
(:mod:`mosaic.core.loaders.exposure`) *warns* about the same footprint
before the migration runs.

`[VERIFY]` §8 (sec11 §11.8.2) — resolved: no runtime path orders loaders by
``loader_depends_on`` (it is warning-only in ``linkml_bridge``). This
orchestrator is therefore the explicit base→dependent sequencer; it does
not rely on any implicit loader ordering.
