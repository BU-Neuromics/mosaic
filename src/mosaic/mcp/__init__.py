"""Mosaic MCP (Model Context Protocol) transport layer (optional ``mcp``
extra, ADR-0009 / issue #182).

A fourth transport alongside REST/GraphQL/CLI, giving any LLM-driven
client one shared, validated way to query Mosaic without hand-maintaining
a capability copy (ADR-0009's Context — the three-way capability-manifest
duplication between Mosaic, Exon, and Aperture this boundary exists to
close). Like the GraphQL layer, this is a THIN wrapper: resources reshape
the shared type/capability model (:mod:`mosaic.core.schema_typing`); no
business logic lives here.

The heavy lifting depends on the ``mcp`` package, which ships in the
optional ``mcp`` extra. Public entry points below import lazily and fail
with an actionable message when the extra is not installed.

**Transport**: Streamable HTTP, mounted onto the same FastAPI app REST/
GraphQL already run in (``mosaic serve --mcp``), not stdio. ADR-0009's
Notes section hedges stdio as "the likely default," but that reading is
architecturally incompatible with the Decision text's actual requirement
— "sharing the same MosaicClient/SchemaRegistry every other transport
already uses" — since stdio runs as a wholly separate client-invoked
process with no access to a running FastAPI app's state at all. Streamable
HTTP is the only transport that can share app state, so it is what is
implemented here; the stdio hedge is non-binding per the ADR's own text.

Public API:

- :func:`create_mcp_app` — ``MosaicClient`` → ``(MCPServer, ASGI app)``
- :func:`mcp_available` — feature probe for callers (CLI, serve)
- :data:`MCP_EXTRA_HINT` — the actionable install-hint message
