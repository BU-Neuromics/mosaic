    """Which ``Host`` headers the MCP transport accepts.

    The SDK enables DNS-rebinding protection by default and, given no
    settings, derives its allow-list from a ``host`` parameter that defaults
    to ``127.0.0.1``. Passing neither — as this module did until #211 — means
    the transport answers only requests whose ``Host`` is loopback, and
    returns ``421 Invalid Host header`` to everything else.

    That is invisible while every caller is a host process on the same
    machine, because they all address it as ``localhost``/``127.0.0.1``. It
    becomes a hard wall the moment the boundary is containerized: a sibling
    container reaching ``http://mosaic:8001/mcp`` sends ``Host: mosaic:8001``,
    and a client on the Docker host sends ``Host: host.docker.internal:…`` —
    both rejected, with an error that says nothing about the Host header
    unless you read the response body.

    The protection is worth keeping (it is what stops a malicious page in a
    browser from driving a localhost MCP server via DNS rebinding), so this
    does not disable it by default. It makes the allow-list configurable, with
    loopback still permitted so nothing about the single-machine case changes.

    ``MOSAIC_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*`` turns the check off, for a deployment that
    has decided its own network boundary is the control — the same judgement
    ``--cors-origin '*'`` already offers on the HTTP surface.
