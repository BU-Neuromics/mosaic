"""MCP server construction: the schema/capability resources (ADR-0009
decision 1, issue #182), the ``validate_query_spec``/``execute_query_spec``
tools (ADR-0009 decision 3, issue #183), the ``count_query_spec``/
``facet_query_spec``/``field_range_query_spec`` tools (issue #195), the
``search_query_spec`` tool (issue #196), the ``converse_query_spec`` tool
(issue #186, registered only when ``MOSAIC_EXON_URL`` is set), and the
``construct-query-spec`` prompt (ADR-0009 decision 4, issue #184). Built
once, at mount time, from a ``MosaicClient``'s ``SchemaRegistry`` — no new
data-access path (ADR-0009: "sharing the same MosaicClient/SchemaRegistry
every other transport already uses").

The four non-execute tools exist because ``QuerySpec`` (ADR-0035) has no
representation for aggregation OR search — ``execute_query_spec`` can only
ever return rows. Mosaic's own aggregation/search surface (``count``/
``facet_counts``/``field_range``/``search``, ADR-0007/#157) was already
shipped for GraphQL; these tools are thin wrappers, not new query logic —
same ``compile_query_spec`` output, same ``MosaicClient`` methods GraphQL's
own resolvers call. Error codes (``UNKNOWN_AGGREGATION_FIELD``,
``UNAGGREGATABLE_FIELD``) are copied verbatim from ``graphql/resolvers.py``'s
``_resolve_aggregate_field`` so a client sees the same failure for the same
field regardless of transport. ``search_query_spec`` deliberately does NOT
add a stricter "is this searchable" gate GraphQL's own ``search{Plural}``
resolvers lack — a non-searchable entity returns an empty result on both
transports, by the same documented design (``schema_typing.py``'s
``EntityCapability.search_available`` docstring): inventing a gate on one
transport only would make the two answer the same call differently.

The two resources are pure functions of the deployment's schema, not
per-request state, so — unlike GraphQL's resolvers, and unlike the two
tools — there is no per-request client lookup for them at all (the SDK's
static/non-templated resources cannot take a ``Context`` parameter in
the first place; see :func:`create_mcp_server`'s docstring). The tools DO
read live data, so they take ``ctx: Context`` and resolve
``request.app.state.hippo_client`` the same way GraphQL's
``context_getter`` does, falling back to the construction-time client.
The prompt is static text (like the resources) — it carries no schema
data of its own, only procedural guidance about the artifact's semantics.

``converse_query_spec`` is the one tool here that is not a wrapper over a
``MosaicClient`` method, and the terms on which it is allowed to exist are
ADR-0010 (Mosaic's first outbound call — a deployment-shape change, not
just a new tool): it delegates server-to-server to Exon's stateless
turn-taking planning core over HTTP (the wire contract is recorded in
``mosaic-demo-small``'s ``add-exon-conversational-contract/design.md``
Decision 8), because Aperture's browser has no backend of its own and must
not hold LLM credentials. It is registered ONLY when ``MOSAIC_EXON_URL``
names that service — an unconfigured deployment does not advertise a tool
it cannot serve, mirroring how ``--mcp`` itself gates this whole module.
Mosaic re-validates whatever ``QuerySpec`` Exon returns, in-process,
before ever handing back a ``proposal`` turn: Exon is an untrusted planner
as far as this boundary is concerned, and "Mosaic validates before
anything executes" has to hold even if Exon's own check is stale or
bypassed. It never calls ``execute_query_spec`` — a ``proposal`` is handed
back for a separate, explicit execute call once a human confirms it, so
"the LLM never decides to execute" holds for this tool too. Its
client-visible failures name the delegate's *role*, never its address
(ADR-0010 decision 5): this surface carries no authn, so the endpoint URL
and any upstream response body go to ``logger`` for the operator instead.

All of the above — the planning delegation, the ADR-0010 relay terms, the
in-process re-validation, and the suspend/recompute semantics — actually
lives in :mod:`mosaic.core.converse_query_spec` (``run_converse_turn``),
shared verbatim with the GraphQL ``converseQuerySpec`` mutation (issue
#205, ``mosaic/graphql/resolvers.py``). This module's own
``converse_query_spec`` tool is a thin wrapper: it resolves the per-request
``MosaicClient``/capability manifest the MCP way (via ``Context``) and
hands both to ``run_converse_turn``.

_CONSTRUCT_QUERY_SPEC_GUIDANCE = """\
How to build a QuerySpec Mosaic will accept (ADR-0009/ADR-0035):

1. Check mosaic://capabilities FIRST. Every anchor/slot/op/edge below must \
come from there -- this guidance tells you the shape, capabilities tells \
you what a specific deployment actually has.

2. Field names are LinkML slot names -- snake_case, exactly as they \
appear in mosaic://schema/mosaic://capabilities. Never invent a \
camelCase rename.

3. A field with kind "reference" NEVER takes a direct filter op (an \
empty filter_ops list on it is not a bug -- check its `predicate` flag \
instead). Express relationship existence/predicates as ONE \
RelatedCondition: {"kind": "related", "edge": <the reference field's \
name>, "quantifier": "some" | "none", "criteria": [FieldCondition, ...]}. \
"some" = at least one match; "none" = no match -- this works uniformly \
whether the relationship is one-to-one or one-to-many, so never simulate \
it with a client-side per-id fan-out (fetch-then-filter in a loop).

4. `columns` is NOT supported yet -- omit it entirely. execute_query_spec \
always returns full entity envelopes; there is no column-projection or \
aggregate-vs-explode compiler on this deployment.

5. `asOf` cannot combine with a RelatedCondition anywhere in `criteria` \
(including nested inside a group) -- pick a point in time OR a \
relationship predicate, not both, on the same QuerySpec.

6. `sort` takes at most ONE field -- Mosaic's query surface has no \
multi-column sort to compile a second entry against.

7. An enum-kind field's value must be one of its exact enum_values -- \
check mosaic://capabilities/mosaic://schema, don't guess a value.

8. Minimal shape: {"v": 1, "anchor": <an exposed entity type>, "mode": \
"AND" | "OR", "criteria": [...]}. `asOf` and `sort` are optional \
top-level additions.

9. A QuerySpec has NO aggregation shape of its own -- execute_query_spec \
always returns full entity rows, never a count or a per-value breakdown. \
If the question is "how many", "how many X per Y", or "what's the \
min/max of X", do NOT answer it by listing rows (sorted or not) and do \
NOT count/group them yourself -- call count_query_spec / \
facet_query_spec / field_range_query_spec instead. A row list is not an \
answer to a counting question, even when every row in it is correct.

10. For a free-text/keyword question ("mentions", "contains the word", \
"about X"), prefer search_query_spec over a `contains` FieldCondition -- \
`contains` is a substring match on ONE field you name; search_query_spec \
ranks across every searchable slot on the entity at once. Check \
search_available on mosaic://capabilities first: an entity with no \
searchable slot returns an empty result, not an error.

Workflow: call validate_query_spec first if you want to check a draft \
without running it; call execute_query_spec once you're ready to fetch \
results -- it validates internally too, and returns the exact same \
{valid, errors} shape (plus items/total) if something's still wrong, so \
you can read the error, fix the one thing it names, and retry."""
