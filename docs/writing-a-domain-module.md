# Writing a Domain Module

This guide walks through building a **`DomainModule`** — the first-party, mutable-data species of `SchemaPackage` — and authoring a versioned data migration that Mosaic runs with full provenance behind a hard validation gate.

> **Who this is for:** Python developers who own a deployment's locally authored operational data (samples, donors, projects — the lab's authoritative records) and need to evolve its *shape* across schema versions. If you distribute externally maintained reference datasets instead, read [Writing a Reference Loader](writing-a-reference-loader.md).

> **`DomainModule` is one kind of `SchemaPackage`.** Both `DomainModule` and `ReferenceLoader` are *species* of the genus `SchemaPackage` (`mosaic.core.loaders.schema_package`), which captures the reusable part — *"contribute a versioned, pinnable schema fragment"* (`name`, `description`, `versions()`, `schema_fragment()`, `depends_on()`, optional `validate()`, and the `provision`/`evolve`/`deprovision` lifecycle hooks).
>
> - A **reference loader** wraps *external, reconstructible* data; its `deprovision` prunes willingly.
> - A **domain module** owns *first-party, mutable* data and migrates it **in place**. Because those records are the deployment's authoritative data, the migration is append-only, id-keyed, and provenanced — every step is auditable and replay-recoverable.

## How a domain migration differs from `mosaic migrate`

| | `mosaic migrate` (DDL) | `DomainModule.evolve` (data) |
|---|---|---|
| Handles | *Additive* schema changes (new optional column, new class) | *Semantic* data transformations (split a field, re-root a value set, change units) |
| Touches | Table structure | Row contents |
| Trigger | Automatic on schema reconcile | A declared `(from_version → to_version)` migration step |

They are complementary. Reach for a `DomainModule` migration only when the *data* must change shape, not just the table.

## 1. The module class

Subclass `DomainModule` from `mosaic.core.loaders.domain_module`. Implement the two genus abstract methods (`versions()`, `schema_fragment()`) plus `migration_steps()`. `provision` is an inherited genus no-op — domain data arrives via `mosaic ingest`, not at schema-install time. `deprovision` is overridden to **refuse by default** when the module owns live data (see §7).

```python
# src/hippo_domain_mylab/module.py
from mosaic.core.loaders.domain_module import (
    DomainModule,
    MigrationContext,
    MigrationStep,
)


class MyLabModule(DomainModule):
    name = "mylab"                       # must match the entry point key
    description = "MyLab operational domain data"

    def versions(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["v1", "v2"]

    def populates_types(self) -> list[str]:
        # Declarative — which classes this module fills with first-party data.
        return ["Specimen"]

    def schema_fragment(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "id": "https://example.org/hippo/mylab",
            "name": "mylab",
            "default_prefix": "mylab",   # REQUIRED — must match name
            "prefixes": {"mylab": "https://example.org/hippo/mylab/"},
            "classes": {
                "Specimen": {
                    "is_a": "Entity",
                    "attributes": {
                        # v2 shape: `kind` is now required
                        "label": {"range": "string"},
                        "kind":  {"range": "string", "required": True},
                    },
                },
            },
        }

    def migration_steps(self) -> list[MigrationStep]:
        return [
            MigrationStep(
                from_version="v1",
                to_version="v2",
                transform=self._v1_to_v2,
                description="derive `kind` from legacy `label`",
            ),
        ]

    def _v1_to_v2(self, ctx: MigrationContext) -> None:
        # Read old-shape records, stage new-shape records that supersede them.
        for old in ctx.client.query("Specimen").items:
            data = old["data"]
            ctx.plan.migrate(
                "Specimen",
                old["id"],
                {"label": data.get("label"), "kind": _infer_kind(data)},
            )
```

The `schema_fragment()` contract is identical to a reference loader's: `default_prefix` **must** equal `name`, and Mosaic auto-injects `provided_by: <name>@<version>` on every introduced element.

---

## 2. The migration model: read-old → write-new → supersede-old

A migration **transform** receives a `MigrationContext` and stages its intended changes onto `ctx.plan`. It must **not** write to the client directly — staging is what keeps the validation gate ahead of every committed write.

- **Read** old-shape records via `ctx.client` (e.g. `ctx.client.query("Specimen").items`). `query()` applies no default page limit, so this reads the whole set.
- **Stage** new-shape records via `ctx.plan`:

| Method | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `plan.migrate(entity_type, old_id, new_data)` | The common 1:1 case. Stages a **new** record (fresh id) and supersedes `old_id` by it. Returns the new id. |
| `plan.put(entity_type, new_data)` | A net-new record with no supersession (e.g. one half of a split). Returns the new id. |
| `plan.supersede(old_id, new_id)` | An explicit supersession edge (pairs with `put` for splits/merges). |

`migrate()` and `put()` fill in system fields for you: a fresh `id`, and `is_available: True` (a migration produces live records). You write only domain slots.

> **Why a new entity, not an in-place edit?** Each migrated record becomes a *new* entity that **supersedes** the old one. Supersession (not same-id upsert) is what emits the `supersede` provenance event and the `superseded_by` lineage edge. A consequence to keep in mind: after migration, anything referencing an old id now points at a superseded/unavailable entity — resolve via the `superseded_by` edge.

---

## 3. The staged dry-run validation gate

`DomainModule.evolve` runs the matching step, then — **before any committed write** — stages the transform's new-shape records and validates them against the **fully merged schema**. This is the in-process equivalent of:

```bash
mosaic ingest --validate-schema <merged-dir> --dry-run
```

The migration **commits only on green**. If the staged output does not validate, `evolve` raises `MigrationGateError` and the deployment's data is left exactly as it was — no new rows, no supersessions, no provenance events.

```python
from mosaic.core.exceptions import MigrationGateError

module = MyLabModule()
try:
    result = module.evolve(client, "v1", "v2")
except MigrationGateError as exc:
    # exc.errors carries the underlying LinkML validation messages.
    print(f"migration blocked: {exc.errors}")
else:
    print(f"migrated {result.created} record(s)")   # LoadResult
```

Only the **new** records are validated; the old superseded rows keep their v1 shape and are never re-validated. `evolve` returns a `LoadResult` whose `created` counts the new-shape records written.

> The gate requires a schema-backed client (one constructed with a `registry`). A migration against a schemaless client raises `MigrationGateError` rather than committing unvalidated writes.

---

## 4. Provenance & lineage

Every step produces a traceable, append-only audit trail:

- the **new** record gets a `create` provenance event;
- the **old** record gets a `supersede` event, tagged `actor=<module name>` and `reason="<name> migration <from>→<to>"` so the history reads as a migration, not a hand edit;
- a `superseded_by` relationship edge links old → new.

Inspect it with `client.history(entity_id)` or by following the `superseded_by` field (`client.get(entity_id, include_unavailable=True)`).

---

## 5. Declaring the entry point

Register the module under the genus group `mosaic.schema_packages` (a `DomainModule` is not a reference loader, so it does **not** use `mosaic.reference_loaders`):

```toml
[project.entry-points."mosaic.schema_packages"]
mylab = "hippo_domain_mylab.module:MyLabModule"
```

The entry-point key must match `DomainModule.name`.

---

## 6. Multi-hop migration chains

`evolve(client, from_version, to_version)` resolves a **path** through your declared migration DAG, not a single edge. Declare one `MigrationStep` per consecutive hop and Mosaic composes them:

```python
def migration_steps(self) -> list[MigrationStep]:
    return [
        MigrationStep("1.0.0", "1.1.0", self._add_kind),
        MigrationStep("1.1.0", "2.0.0", self._split_name),
        # optional bulk shortcut — preferred when present:
        MigrationStep("1.0.0", "2.0.0", self._fast_path),
    ]
```

How the resolver behaves:

- **Fewest hops win.** The path finder does a breadth-first search over the edges, so a declared **shortcut edge** (a direct `1.0.0 → 2.0.0`) is preferred over the equivalent multi-step chain automatically. A single-hop upgrade is just a one-edge path — no special case.
- **Each hop is staged → gated → committed in turn.** A hop reads the *current live* records via `ctx.client.query(...)` (which excludes superseded rows), so it sees the previous hop's output, never its retired predecessors — hops never double-process.
- **Below-floor fails loud.** If the deployment's current version predates your oldest step (it is not a node anywhere in the DAG), `evolve` raises `MigrationFloorError` (*upgrade to ≥<floor> first*). Ship every step back to your supported floor, Alembic-`versions/`-style.
- **Unreachable target fails loud.** If the target can't be reached from a known node, `evolve` raises `MigrationStepNotFoundError` carrying the declared edges.

> **Per-hop validation gate.** Each hop's output is validated against the client's *current* merged schema. That is correct when every intermediate shape is an additive subset of the target schema (the common case). Validating each hop against its own historical merged schema, and wrapping the whole chain in one commit-or-rollback, is the lifecycle orchestrator's job (sec11 §11.5.2) — until then, **a fault partway through a chain leaves the already-committed hops in place** (no whole-`evolve` rollback; sec11 §11.8.1).

---

## 7. Deprovisioning: refuse by default

`mosaic reference deprovision <name>` tears a package down. A `DomainModule` owns the deployment's **authoritative** records, so `DomainModule.deprovision` **refuses by default** when any `populates_types()` class still holds live rows — silently soft-deleting them on uninstall would be a data-loss event. Export first, then re-run with `--force` to soft-delete (the standard availability transition; the provenance trail is kept). With no live data it is a quiet no-op.

The orchestrator also **refuses to deprovision a package that any installed package still `depends_on`** (it names the dependents — deprovision those first). Both guards are the asymmetry with reference loaders, whose external, reconstructible rows are pruned willingly.

---

## Checklist

- [ ] `DomainModule.name` matches the `mosaic.schema_packages` entry-point key
- [ ] `schema_fragment()` declares `default_prefix: <name>`
- [ ] Each `MigrationStep` covers one consecutive `(from_version → to_version)` hop; ship every step back to your supported floor
- [ ] The transform reads via `ctx.client` and stages via `ctx.plan` — it never writes to the client directly
- [ ] New-shape records validate against the merged schema (the gate enforces this; test it with both a valid and a deliberately invalid transform)
- [ ] `populates_types()` declares the classes the module owns (this is what `deprovision` checks for live data)
