# data-ingestion Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change epic-007-feature-004. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: User can ingest data from configured external sources
Given a user has configured external data sources, when they run 'hippo ingest', then the system processes and loads data into the internal database according to the source configuration files.

#### Scenario: Successful ingestion with configured sources
- **WHEN** user has configured at least one external data source in the configuration file
- **AND** they run the command 'hippo ingest'
- **THEN** the system reads each configured source
- **AND** processes the data according to source-specific configuration
- **AND** loads the processed data into the internal database
- **AND** displays a success message with count of records processed

#### Scenario: Ingestion processes data from all configured sources
- **WHEN** user has multiple external data sources configured
- **AND** they run the command 'hippo ingest'
- **THEN** the system processes data from all configured sources
- **AND** maintains source-specific logging of processed records

### Requirement: Error when no data sources are configured
Given a user runs 'hippo ingest' without configured sources, when they execute data ingestion, then the system shows an error message indicating that no data sources are configured.

#### Scenario: No sources configured shows error
- **WHEN** user runs 'hippo ingest' with no data sources configured
- **THEN** the system displays an error message: "No data sources configured. Please add external data sources to your configuration file."
- **AND** exits with a non-zero status code

#### Scenario: Empty sources configuration shows error
- **WHEN** user runs 'hippo ingest' with an empty sources list in configuration
- **THEN** the system displays the same error message as when no sources are configured
- **AND** exits with a non-zero status code
