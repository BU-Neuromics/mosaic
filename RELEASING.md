# Releasing Hippo

Releases are cut by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` git tag. The `Release` workflow
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) does the rest — see "What automation does"
below. This pipeline is DataHelix 1.0 epic P1.1 (issue #97): every release
must produce a **digest-addressed image** so the DataHelix certified-frontier
ledger (`certification/composition.lock.json`) has evidence to pin.

## Version conventions

- `pyproject.toml` `project.version` is the single source of truth, with no
  `v` prefix (`0.10.2`).
- Git tags and CHANGELOG headings carry the `v` prefix (`v0.10.2`).
- The `validate` job fails the release when the tag and `pyproject.toml`
  disagree.

## Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Retitle the `## [Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` to
   `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD (short title)` and start a fresh `## [Unreleased]`
   stub above it. The release notes are extracted from this section
   (`scripts/extract_release_notes.py`) and the workflow fails if it is
   missing.
3. Land those changes on `main` via the normal PR flow.
4. Tag and push:

   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Equivalently, dispatch the **Release** workflow (Actions → Release →
   Run workflow) on `main` with the tag name as input — the workflow
   creates the tag at the dispatched ref. Useful when tag pushes aren't
   available (e.g. sandboxed sessions).

## What automation does on tag push

| Job | Output |
|---|---|
| `validate` | tag ↔ `pyproject.toml` version check |
| `build` | wheel + sdist (`uv build`) |
| `image` | `ghcr.io/bu-neuromics/hippo:{X.Y.Z,latest}`, digest-addressed |
| `release` | GitHub Release with CHANGELOG notes, `dist/*`, and `image-digest.json` |
| `pypi` | PyPI publish — **gated**, see below |

`image-digest.json` is the machine-readable asset the DataHelix bump bot
reads to move the `composition.lock.json` pin to
`ghcr.io/bu-neuromics/hippo@sha256:…`:

```json
{
  "component": "hippo",
  "repo": "BU-Neuromics/hippo",
  "version": "X.Y.Z",
  "image": "ghcr.io/bu-neuromics/hippo",
  "digest": "sha256:…",
  "ref": "ghcr.io/bu-neuromics/hippo@sha256:…"
}
```

## PyPI publish gate ([HUMAN] decision pending)

The name `hippo` is **already taken on PyPI** by an unrelated project, so the
`pypi` job is disabled until two things happen:

1. A distribution name is settled — e.g. `hippo-linkml` (verified available);
   the import package stays `hippo` either way. Rename via
   `project.name` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. A [trusted publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) is
   configured on PyPI for this repository (workflow `release.yml`,
   environment `pypi`).

Then set the repository variable `PYPI_PUBLISH` to `true`. Until then, wheels
and sdists are still attached to every GitHub Release.

## Retro-tags

The v0.10.x releases predate this pipeline. Their tags (`v0.10.0`,
`v0.10.1`) point at the historical release commits so artifact provenance is
verifiable. Retro-tags do **not** trigger the release workflow (the workflow
file does not exist at those commits) — they are provenance markers only; no
artifacts are published for them retroactively.

## LinkML pin coupling

Hippo's public behavior tracks its LinkML pins (`linkml`, `linkml-runtime`,
`linkml-store` in `pyproject.toml`): a LinkML patch bump can change validation
or generation behavior, so **any pin change forces at least a patch release**,
and the CHANGELOG entry must name the old and new pins (see the Key Decisions
log in `design/INDEX.md`).
